# ML-internship-project

## Used car price prediction project. 
This project was part of an internship from Verzeo, where our team developed few ML models to predict prices of used cars.

The Jupyter notebook files contains pre-processing, training, and testing. 
Here we have training 4 models using different algorightms
1.	Linear regression
2.	K Nearest Neighbours
3.	XGboost
4.	Random Forest


### Dataset used: 
1. Data_train: was used for training and testing the performance
2. Data_test: was submitted to our mentor for check
